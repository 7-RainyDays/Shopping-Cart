PLAN

Think about the component and the folder structure. How could you set up your application? Which components or functionalities do you need? It’s a good idea to note this down somewhere you can easily get to and refer back and add to it to keep track.

pages:
-homepage
-shop-page
-checkout with overview

Component:
-Navbar
-Product-Grid
-Product-Card
-shopping-Card

Cart:
//Cart Symbol nur für Anzahl der Items
//Nutzer Informieren wenn item reingepackt
//Zusammenfassung aller Items irgendwo

TODO:
-add rating and count to product cards
